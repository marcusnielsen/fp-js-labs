# FP JS labs

A series of laborations to learn a some functional JavaScript.

# Usage

Each lesson will be in a subfolder like `s01-loops/e01-forEach` where `s = season` and `e = episode`.
A season will be around a certain focused area.
An episode is one small task, and each successor will build on the previous one.

The folders might contain some theory that you can read before doing the laborations.
