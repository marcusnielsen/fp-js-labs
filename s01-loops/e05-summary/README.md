# S01E05 Loops -Summary

## Problem to solve

The system will load an array of users with IDs, names, and a subscription flag.

1. When the data is loaded, you should run an application.

2. The application should first replace sensitive data with the string "Anonymous" before doing anything else. IDs and names are sensitive data.

3. The application should filter out active subscribers.

4. The application should then be able to print out a JSON string of the result.
